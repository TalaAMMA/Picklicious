                <p>After living abroad for more than 25 years and being exposed to many international cultures and
                    cuisines.
                    We decided to move back home and start our own family business. We were determined to come up with
                    an
                    innovative concept that combines our love for food and the best homemade gourmet delicious pickles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Picklicious” was born, to offer a variety of scrumptious and yummy-luscious products, as well as an
                    assortment of sauces and chutneys. Picklicious also offers one of the highest quality infused salts
                    and
                    fleur de sel made of 100% natural, unrefined, unpolluted, with no preservatives added, produced in
                    one
                    of Lebanon's most ancient and renowned towns Anfeh, where we can find the most beautiful and
                    cleanest
                    shorelines in Lebanon.
